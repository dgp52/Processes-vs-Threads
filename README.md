# Processes-vs-Threads
0. Introduction
 In this assignment, you will get some practice with multithreading and multiprocessing, as well as
some simple file system calls. For this program, you will write both a multithreaded and a
multiprocessed multipart compression program.
 The base compression you will be using is fairly simple. Run Length Encoding (RLE) is a
compression method that finds repeated characters and replaces the run with a number representing the
number of adjacent copies.

 Unencoded: Encoded:
 jjjjjjjjoooaaaaanrr 8j3o5a1n2r
 As you can see, RLE has some inefficiencies. Firstly, converting the character 'n' to the symbol '1n' is
increasing size by adding unnecessary information. Secondly, converting 'rr' to '2r' is no savings in
space, but costs computation time to determine, write and read later. So, for this assignment you will
implement a modification of RLE; Length Of Long Sequence compression, or LOLS. LOLS is like
RLE except that single characters and pairs are not encoded:
Unencoded: Encoded:
 jjjjjjjjoooaaaaanrr 8j3o5anrr
1. Design
 Besides simply compressing a file with LOLS, you will need to provide the ability to do multipart
compression. That is, a single uncompressed file is compressed, and that compressed file is broken into
chunks that are each made individual files. This results in multiple much smaller files.
Unencoded: RLE encoded: LOLS encoded: Multipart LOLS encoded:
bigfile.txt bigfile_txt_RLE bigfile_txt_LOLS bigfile_txt_LOLS0
 jjjjjjjjoooaaaaanrr 8j3o5a1n2r 8j3o5anrr 8j2o
bigfile_txt_LOLS1
 o5anrr
 In order to be maximally efficient, your code should spawn a worker element for each part it writes.
In the case of your process version, your code should generate a child process per part to read, and your
thread version should spawn child threads per part. Each worker element should access the
uncompressed file simultaneously. Your parent/manager process/thread should not do any work with
the uncompressed file (although it may check it). Each worker element should open its own handle to
the file and read from the segment of the file it needs to encode:
Unencoded:
bigfile.txt
 v-- worker element 0 starts here
jjjjjjjjoooaaaaanrr
 ^-- worker element 1 starts here
2. Implementation
 While only two parts are shown, your code should support splitting the uncompressed file into
potentially any number of multiparts. Your code should be robust in checking for errors, especially
filesystem errors. Namely, does the uncompressed file exist, do you have read access for it, do
compressed files for that uncompressed files already exist, and so on. Be sure your compression
program wait()s on child processes and join()s spawned threads.
Your code should take the form of:
compressT_LOLS(<file to compress>, <number of parts>)
compressR_LOLS(<file to compress>, <number of parts>)
.. for thread and process versions, respectively.
 Your code should automatically name the compressed file just as illustrated above. It should replace
the period before the file extension with an underbar '_' and postpend '_LOLS' and the part number, if
there is one. For files compressed without multiparts, there should be no part number:
compressT_LOLS("./stuff.txt", 1):
compresses "./stuff.txt" into "./stuff_txt_LOLS" using threads
compressR_LOLS("./things.txt", 3):
compresses "./things.txt" into 3 files; "./things_txt_LOLS0", "./things_txt_LOLS1" and
"./things_txt_LOLS2" using processes
 Your code should put the newly-generated compressed files into the same directory as the
uncompressed file.
 When calculating char lengths to read, please round up toward the earliest compressed file part. For
example, if you have an uncompressed file that consists of 13 characters and you must split it into 2
files, the first compressed part ought to have the encoding for the first 7 characters, and the 2nd
compressed part the encoding for the remaining 6.
Unencoded: Encoded:
hhhhhhhiiiiii part0: 7h
part1: 6i
 Your code should shut down responsibly in the event of an error. All threads should be exited. All
processes should be wait()ed on. All file handles should be closed and memory freed.
3. Performance Analysis and Testing
 You should determine a good series of tests for your code. Try to exploit corner cases, like parts
breaking a sequence that would have been encoded into a sequence that is too short to be encoded, and
making sure your code does the right thing (i.e. "oooo" being broken into "oo" and "oo" across two
files). Be sure to document your test plan.
 You should also determine which is faster/better for this job, processes or threads. Document the way
you test this, as well as your results. Keep in mind system details you have no control over (at
minimum, other students) will affect your results, so you should run a fairly large number of your tests.
Be sure to document your findings.
 Be sure to explore all the variables at your disposal: the length of the unencoded file, the number of
parts, the amount of replication in the file and process vs thread modes, etc. In order to compare your
results across all variables, it would be useful to think of a similar way to score the results. Something
like seconds of runtime per byte of unencoded file length is one possibility, but it may leave out the
impact of multipart creation. Think of what dimensions are similar and what you can control. You may
want to use more than one metric.
